## Project Description
This project is part of the *Getting and Cleaning Data* course from Johns Hopkins University on Coursera.org.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

## Study design and data processing
### Collection of the raw data
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

### Notes on the original (raw) data

For each record in the dataset it is provided:
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
- Its activity label.
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

## Creating the tidy datafile
### Guide to create the tidy data files

The tidy data file was created by doing the following:

1. Merged training and test sets to create on data set:
  - Downloaded data: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
  - Unzipped file: creates ```UCI HAR Dataset``` folder with all untidy data and files
  - Read and merged train and test for activity, data, and subject:
    - Read and merged **activity** files: ```y_train.txt``` and ```y_test.txt``` into ```data_activity_all```
    - Read and merged **data** files: ```x_train.txt``` and ```x_test.txt``` into ```data_observed_all```
    - Read and merged **subject** files: ```subject_train.txt``` and ```subject_test.txt``` into ```data_subject_all```
  - Read data from ```features.txt``` into ```features_names```
  - Replaced the variable (column) names of ```data_observed_all``` using data 2nd column of ```features_names```
  - Merged ```data_subject_all```, ```data_activity_all```, and ```data_observed_all``` into ```data_all```
2. Extracted measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement:
  - Extracted rows from ```features_names``` that contained word **mean** or **std**
  - Combined them into ```data_mean_std```
  - Extracted columns from ```data_all``` corresponding to **subject** (col1) and **activity** (col2) as well as columns containing **mean** or **std** (```data_mean_std```)
  - Stored new table into ```data_table```
3. Used descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set:
  - Read ```activity_labels.txt``` to extract activity descriptions (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, and LAYING) into ```activity_labels```
  - Replaced each activity code (1,2,...,6) from ```data_table``` with the corresponding **activity label** from ```activity_labels```
  - Changed the variable name **activity_code** (2nd column) to **activity**
4. Labeled the data set with descriptive variable names:
  - Subset all columns corresponding to observed variables, excluding subject and activity, into ```data_table1```
  - Substituted all the observed abbreviations in the variables of ```data_table1``` for its corresponding full word:
    - "t" for "time"
    - "f" for "frequency"
    - "Acc" for "accelerometer"
    - etc.
  - Merged again the modified ```data_table1``` and the first 2 columns of ```data_table```
  - Removed ```data_table1``` as it was temporary
  - Saved these data into a new file ```tidy_data_table_1.txt```
5. Created a second tidy data set with the average of each variable for each **activity** and each **subject**:
  - Aggregated **subject + activity** and applied **mean**
  - Saved these data into a new file ```tidy_data_table_2.txt```

### Cleaning of the data

The data cleaning process has created 2 data sets:
- ```tidy_data_table_1.txt``` contains all data observations on all the variables corresponding to a **mean** or **standard deviation** with **subject** and **activity** details in the first 2 columns
- ```tidy_data_table_2.txt``` contains the previous data but grouped by subject (30 subjects) and activity (6 activities).
  - Subject 1 WALKING
  - Subject 1 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
  - ...
  - Subject 2 WALKING
  - ...
  - Subject 30 LAYING
